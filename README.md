# Network Traffic Capture and Analysis with Wireshark

## üìå Objective
Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types using Wireshark, followed by a deeper analysis of observed HTTP, ICMP, and DNS traffic.

## üõ† Tools Used
- **Wireshark** (Stable Release 4.4.8 - macOS Arm Disk Image for M4 processor)
- macOS Terminal (for ping tests)
- Web Browser (for generating HTTP/HTTPS traffic)

## üìÇ Files in This Repository
- `traffic_capture.pcap` ‚Üí Packet capture file with all recorded network traffic.
- `screenshots/` ‚Üí Folder containing screenshots of the Wireshark interface and filters used.
- `README.md` ‚Üí This documentation file.

## üîç Steps Followed
1. Installed **Wireshark** (macOS Arm version for Apple Silicon M4).
2. Started capture on the active network interface (`en0`).
3. Opened a few websites and ran `ping google.com` to generate traffic.
4. Stopped capture after approximately **1 minute**.
5. Applied filters to view specific protocols:
   - `http`
   - `dns`
   - `tcp`
6. Saved the capture as `traffic_capture.pcap`.

## üìë Protocols Identified
| Protocol | Description | Example Packet Details |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **HTTP** | Hypertext Transfer Protocol used for web communication | GET request to example.com |
| **DNS**  | Domain Name System for resolving domain names to IPs | Query for google.com |
| **TCP**  | Transmission Control Protocol for reliable data transfer | SYN packet initiating a connection |

# Network Traffic Analysis Report

## 1. HTTP Traffic
- **Observation:**
  - Detected a GET request over IPv6 to `2606:4700:9762:c46...` (likely Cloudflare infrastructure).
  - Request path contained `/MFAwTjBMMEowSDAHBgUrDgMCGgQU...`
  - Source: `2401:4900:1c97:36a7...`
  - Protocol: HTTP (port 80, unencrypted)
  - User-Agent: `com.apple.trustd/3.0` (macOS trust service)
  - OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) response observed for SSL certificate validation.

- **Impact/Notes:**
  - Standard macOS behavior for certificate trust checks.
  - Traffic unencrypted ‚Äî metadata could be visible if intercepted.

---

## 2. ICMP Traffic
- **Observation:**
  - Ping (echo) requests/replies between:
    - `192.168.1.11` ‚Üî `192.168.1.1` (local gateway)
    - `192.168.1.11` ‚Üî `142.250.192.142` (Google infrastructure)
  - Multiple **Destination unreachable (Port unreachable)** responses from `192.168.1.1`
  - Packet sizes from 98 bytes (normal ping) to 1382 bytes (larger payload tests).

- **Impact/Notes:**
  - Likely connectivity testing or path MTU discovery.
  - ‚ÄúPort unreachable‚Äù may indicate a probe to a closed UDP port.

---

## 3. DNS Traffic
- **Observation:**
  - DNS queries from `192.168.1.11` to resolver `192.168.1.1`
  - Resolved domains:
    - `whatsapp.com`
    - `graph.whatsapp.com`
    - `mmx-ds.cdn.whatsapp.net`
    - `media.fbcdn.net`
    - `media.fbm19-2.fna.whatsapp.net`
  - Query types: AAAA (IPv6), A (IPv4), CNAME, HTTPS
  - Responses point to Meta/WhatsApp CDN infrastructure.

- **Impact/Notes:**
  - Device was actively using WhatsApp services.
  - HTTPS queries indicate preparation for encrypted connections.

---

## 4. Summary of Findings
- **Normal Activity:**
  - OCSP requests for certificate checks (macOS)
  - ICMP pings for connectivity
  - DNS lookups for WhatsApp
- **Points of Interest:**
  - OCSP traffic is HTTP (unencrypted)
  - ICMP ‚ÄúPort unreachable‚Äù may require further review

---

## 5. Recommendations
1. Enable **OCSP stapling or HTTPS** for certificate checks to avoid unencrypted requests.
2. Review the cause of repeated ICMP port errors to ensure no misconfigured services.
3. No malicious activity detected from the provided packets ‚Äî traffic matches expected macOS + WhatsApp patterns.

## üèÜ Outcome
- Learned how to **capture and filter** network packets using Wireshark.
- Identified and analyzed multiple network protocols.
- Gained hands-on packet analysis skills.

**Note:** This analysis is based on selected packet captures and may not reflect all network activity.
